Homework #3

I have created a new branch. Data Models - Commissioning
This branch is for creating a good data model. I wish to create inventory files and a commissioning playbook to push configurations to the new devices. I would love to add the compliance report I created (but need to fix) to the end of the playbook to sanity check the new build.
